Proof of concept that adds a screen capture service to your browser.  This will only run on Intel Macs in Firefox or Safari.  You must have BrowserPlus (http://browserplus.yahoo.com/) installed.

Q: Why screen capture from your browser?  
A: One idea is that it'd make it easier to submit more detailed bug reports.

Q: Why only Mac OS X?  I have BrowserPlus installed on Windows.
A: OS X has a command line program "screencapture" that makes this really easy.  This is just a proof of concept.
